# My First Coding Assignment #
![Getting Started](./demo.png)
## About Me ##
Hello! My name is Heather and I live in the beautiful Hudson Valley of New York. For work, I manage concert production and at home, I have two of the sweetest rescue dogs on the planet (one was rescued from Taiwan and the other is from Sonoma County, California). In my free time, I enjoy gardening, yoga, cooking healthy food, drawing, and recently began painting and re-learning how to play piano. 
## Past Coding Experience ##
I have zero coding experience. However, my older brother is a software developer and I've gone cross-eyed on a number of occasions looking at his computer screen!
## Career Goals ##
1. I'm still forming my exact career goals.
2. That said, once I finish University of Florida's web design program, I'm hoping to secure a remote front end developer or web designer position and if the opportunity presents itself, ideally with a music industry or purpose-driven company. 
3. Additionally, I'd potentially like to start my own web design company and eventually get to the point where I can do that full-time and pick and choose the projects I take on.
